# Remote launch

This document discusses the remote launch capabilities of wiredflow.
Remote launch is an instruction to execute a program on a remote server. 
For example, with this mechanism it is possible to run 9 tasks on one virtual machine with 16 GB RAM, and 1 task on a machine with 64 GB RAM.
This is very convenient when one of the tasks requires a lot of resources and executed infrequently.

## Problem localization

The first thing to start with is to determine which task is too slow.

## Custom remote launcher implementation

In progress
