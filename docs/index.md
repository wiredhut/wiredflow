Welcome to wiredflow open-source tool documentation! 

Wiredflow is a lightweight Python library for configuring ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) pipelines. 
Designed to create services with multi-step data processing using just Python and nothing more.

The documentation is organized into two large sections: 

- **Common description** - provides general information about how the library works, what its advantages and limitations are. 
  Also in this section you can find detailed information about the interior of the library;
- **Tutorials** - is a step-by-step guide showing from the very beginning how to work
  with wiredflow and construct own multi-threading or multi-processes services

There is also an **"Additional"** section with different useful pages. 
For example, in the "Additional" section you can find information about publications 
using wiredflow as well as descriptions of real commercial use cases.

In this section there is a page describing how to contribute into library - it is important
