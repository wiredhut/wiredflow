# Contribution guide

This is an open-source library. That means you can also make changes, 
fix bugs, and suggest new features. To do most effectively, follow the 
guide we compiled just for you. 

Good luck!

## Check documentation

Please take a look at the "General description" documentation section. 
It will help you understand what terms are used in the description and during the discussions,
and what components are used in the library.

It is worth carefully exploring the section [Architecture of wiredflow (for developers)](../common/architecture.md).
In this document you will find all the necessary explanations about the internal organization of the library. 
So, our advice is "Explore the architecture before source code modification". 

## Check issues

If you are already familiar with the architecture of the project, then it's time to check the [current issues
of the wiredflow](https://github.com/wiredhut/wiredflow/issues). 
If among the open issues there are those you would like to implement, then you can offer your candidacy in the comments.
If there is no functionality (or a bug that you discovered) among the open issues that you would like 
to see in the framework, create your own item in issues or in discussions. 

Once you've created an issue, you can wait for some of the maintainers to look at it and put their 
comments. Or, if you are confident enough, you can start implementing proposed fixes.

## Create a new branch and prepare PR

To make changes to the framework you will need to create a separate branch and go through a code review procedure. 

## Enjoy results of your work!

So yes, this is an important section.
You did a great job. Even if your PR was not accepted (please don't get upset) - you still tried 
very hard, and we appreciate it!
