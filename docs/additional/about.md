# About us and related project

Hi, we are [Wiredhut team](https://github.com/wiredhut)!

We are pretty small company and working on various service 
integration projects for real estate and telecom companies. 

Our experience gained during the implementation of projects sometimes turns into
open-source projects such as **wiredflow**. 
As a rule, initially we prepare such tools to simplify development within our team. 
If we feel that our findings can be useful to other developers, we share 
them via modules.

Hope you've noticed that we treat both the functionality of the module, 
and the design of the documentation and usage examples with love. 
Open-source development is not our
primary activity, but we try to do our best to share our findings (and improve it from time to time) with colleagues.

We really appreciate your feedback. 
If you have any questions, would like to take part into development or looking 
for collaboration - feel free to contact us :)

Sincerely yours, [Wiredhut](https://wiredhut.com/)
