# Wiredflow is your friend

When you start using **wiredflow** to solve real tasks, you may find that some of the flows structures are difficult to implement
using native functionality. For example, to assign several data sources to a core logic block without using intermediate storages.

When this happens, keep in mind: "Wiredflow is your friend". Implementation through storages is almost always more reliable
and robust even if you use as storages local files. Thus, Wiredflow encourages you to use more robust solutions in designing services.

However, if you are sure about what you are doing, you can always implement custom blocks and work around this limitation.
Because Wiredflow is your friend, and real friends won't force you to do something you don't want to.
